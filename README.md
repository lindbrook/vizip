### vizip: vizualize ideal points

Compute and visualize three aspects of political polarization in the US Congress: ideological distance, ideological dispersion and ideological overlap.

The current version of this package uses three flavors of ideal points: 1) "common space" DW-NOMINATE, 2) "common space" DW-NOMINATE (weekly), and 3) regular DW-NOMINATE. These data are available at <http://voteview.org/>.
